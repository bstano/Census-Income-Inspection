# Census-Income-Inspection

The purpose of this project is to use 2020 Census data to determine what demographic factors are significant predictors for a person's income. 

This was evaluated using average values of census tracts (small groupings of people within the same county). Average census tract income was predicted using average census tract demographic data.

Each of the Rmarkdown files can be knitted into PDFs for easier reading.
